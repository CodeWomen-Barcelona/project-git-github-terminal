### Git-it app to practise with Git and GitHub

**Practice makes perfect** they say, and with learning to code it certainly is true. The more you do certain things, the better you'll  
remember. Working with the terminal and with Git and GitHub will become a routine if you practise it a bit.

Git-it is a small app that you can use for this. Download it [here](https://github.com/jlord/git-it-electron/releases). After downloading it, you run the app by:  
* Mac: go to your Downloads, double-click the Git-it icon and in the pop-up window click 'Open'
* Windows: go to your downloads folder and double-click the executable (.exe file)
* Linux: go to your downloads folder and double-click the executable (.exe file)

**Start practising!**  
Open Git-it and click the button to begin the first challenge. You also need Visual Studio Code and your terminal. Follow along  
with the instructions in each challenge and use the terminal or editor as instructed.
